      <h2>How It Works:</h2>
      <p>
        We meet all of our new clients for a free one hour evaluation session. The purpose of 
        this session is to get to know each other, and to better understand what goals you are 
        trying to reach as a player. We assess your current capabilities and really get a feel 
        for how we can most effectively instruct you to being your best. There is no obligation and no hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once training begins, we meet regularly with our clients and work on improving specific 
        skill sets. We always send our players home with 'homework' to help them improve on their 
        own time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment is accepted through cash or Venmo.&#8482; We offer a $5.00 per session discount
        for payments made in cash. We are very flexible, and can work with you to form payment 
        plans if need be. There is no contract and no obligation. Our only rule is that a 24-hour 
        cancellation notice needs to be given for missing training at no charge.
